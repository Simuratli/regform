    <p class="text text-color-main text description">It is UDS Systems's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                href="https://my.uds.systems/">https://my.uds.systems/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
        "https://my.uds.systems/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
        information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to
        explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
        circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information
        we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
    <p class="text text-color-main text description">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted
        on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your

    <h2 class="dark-blue">Website Visitors</h2>
    <p class="text text-color-main text description">Like most website operators, UDS Systems collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such
        as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UDS
        Systems's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UDS Systems's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, UDS Systems may release non-personally-identifying information in
        the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
    <p class="text text-color-main text description">UDS Systems also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
        https://my.uds.systems/ blog posts. UDS Systems only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under
        the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-blue">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p class="text text-color-main text description">Certain visitors to UDS Systems's websites choose to interact with
        UDS Systems in ways that require UDS Systems to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type
        of information that UDS Systems gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
        who sign up for a blog at https://my.uds.systems/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-blue">Security</h2>
    <p class="text text-color-main text description">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but

        absolute security.</p>
